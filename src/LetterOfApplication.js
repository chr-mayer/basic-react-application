          <p>Dear Sirs,</p>
          <p>My name is Christof Mayer and I would like to express my interest in applying for the position as a Frontend Developer.
Iâ€™ve always dreamed of becoming a Software Developer and I believe that a position in the field of Frontend Development with React.js would set me miles ahead to reaching my goal.
Please also note the documents I sent to office@goodbag.io.
